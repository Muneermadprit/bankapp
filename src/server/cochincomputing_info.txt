About US
History
Bethel Foundation, the mother organization of this educational institution was registered in the year 1975, as a non-profit motive entity. After a few years, the educational project was initiated as a small play school under the name “Ding Dong Kindergarten”.
The main pillars of the organization during the initial period were Ms.Edith Virginia Greet, an American social worker and Shri.Thomas Vadakekut, a renowned business man and an eminent journalist.
In 1985, the Board of Directors decided to upgrade the kindergarten to a full-fledged English Medium School, affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, and also took a decision to change the name of the school as Greets Academy and later as Greets Public School. The development of the school to the present level is the contribution of Shri.Thomas Vadakekut, the Chairman of the organization, with his vision, specific planning, team work and sincere hard work. Innovations in infrastructure, new technologies, disciplined campus and also quality of faculties are imperative for making an educational institution vibrant and successful. This was the vision of Shri.Thomas Vadakekut and with this dream, he shaped out this temple of learning to the present glorious level, for grooming the disciplined citizens of tomorrow.
Now the organization has developed into a large institution, spread in more than 2 Acres of land in the heart of Kochi city. Bethel Foundation owns the school and manages its affairs through a dedicated and committed  Board of Directors.

Curriculum
The School is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education and the medium of instruction is English.


We provide a platform for active involvement of the students in all the domains of development. Apart from the subjects offered for primary classes we give utmost importance to co-curricular activities like dance, music, art, craft, physical education etc.


To develop the creative talents, the students of classes III to X are assessed in co-curricular activities like Keyboard, Western Music , Light Music, Dance, Band, Chess, Table Tennis, Handball, Basketball, Throwball, Volleyball, Teakwondo, Home Science, Art, Craft and Yoga. Well trained and experienced tutors equip the students to perform their best according to their skills and interests.


For classes IX & X, the overall performance of the students is based on their achievement in scholastic & co-scholastic areas. In co-scholastic areas we assess life skills, literary and creative skills, scientific skills, work education, drawing & painting, attitude & values, health & physical education and first aid.


Students of classes XI & XII are continuously evaluated on the basis of their performance in class tests, cyclic tests, midterm and terminal exams in an academic year. For the students of class X and XII we conduct model exams to equip them to face the board examination confidently.
